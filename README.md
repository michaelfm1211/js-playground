This is a stand-alone version of the MDN interactive demo snippet, with a few more personal touches:
- Saves your code in the URL as you type, so it can be quickly shared/bookmarked/saved.
- Button to quickly convert your code into a [Stack Snippet](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/358992/ive-been-told-to-create-a-runnable-example-with-stack-snippets-how-do-i-do). Useful for Stack Overflow.

The playground can be used on any modern browser, but it's especially useful on mobile devices.
